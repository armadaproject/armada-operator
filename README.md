# armada-operator
`armada-operator` is a small [go](https://go.dev/) project to automate the 
installation (and eventually management) of a fully-functional 
[Armada](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada) deployment
to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster using the Kubernetes 
[operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

## Description
Armada is a multi-Kubernetes batch job scheduler. This operator aims to make
Armada easy to deploy and, well, operate in a Kubernetes cluster. 

## Quickstart

Want to start hacking right away?

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run the operator. You can use 
[KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to run a local cluster for testing, or you 
can run against a remote cluster.  

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your 
kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Start a Development Cluster

This section assumes you have [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) installed.

If you do not have a Kubernetes cluster to test against, you can start one using the following command:
```bash
make create-dev-cluster
```

### Install using Helm

First, add the `gresearch` public Helm registry:
```bash
helm repo add gresearch https://g-research.github.io/charts
```

After that, you can install the Armada Operator using Helm:
```bash
helm install armada-operator gresearch/armada-operator --namespace armada-system --create-namespace
```

### Build & install from scratch

Run the following command to install all Armada external dependencies (Apache Pulsar, Redis, PostgreSQL, NGINX, Prometheus)
```bash
make dev-setup
```

Then:
```bash
make dev-install-controller
```
Which will:
- install each CRD supported by the armada-operator on the cluster
- create a pod inside the kind cluster running the armada-operator controllers

**Note:** You may need to wait for some services (like Pulsar) to finish 
coming up to proceed to the next step. Check the status of 
the cluster with `$ kubectl get -n armada pods`.

Finally:
```bash
kubectl apply -n armada -f $(REPO_ROOT)/dev/quickstart/armada-crds.yaml
```

Which will deploy samples of each CRD. Once every Armada service is deployed,
you should have a fully functional install of Armada running.

To stop the development cluster:
```bash
make delete-dev-cluster
```

This will totally destroy your development Kind cluster. 

### Local development

Before running the Operator, we first need to install the CRDs by running the following command:
```bash
make install
```

To run the operator locally, you can use the following command:
```bash
make run
```

To uninstall the Operator CRDs, you can use the following command:
```bash
make uninstall
```

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute bug-reports or ideas for enhancements via 
GitHub's issue system. 

Code contributions are also welcome. When submitting a pull-request please 
ensure it references a relevant issue as well as making sure all CI checks 
pass.

## Testing

Please test contributions thoroughly before requesting reviews. At a minimum:
```bash
make test-unit
make test-integration
make lint
```
should all succeed without error. 

Add and change appropriate unit and integration tests to ensure your changes 
are covered by automated tests and appear to be correct.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster
