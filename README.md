Armada Operator is a Kubernetes-native Operator for simpler installation of [Armada](https://armadaproject.io).
This project introduces [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) for Armada services and provides a controller to manage the lifecycle of these services.

## How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronising resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

## Installing Armada Operator

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [Go v1.21+](https://golang.org/doc/install) - required for the Quickstart `make kind-all` target

### Quickstart

To start immediately with Armada and the Operator, run the following `make` target:

```bash
make kind-all
```

This command runs the following `make` targets:

* `kind-create-cluster` - creates a `kind` cluster using the configuration from `hack/kind-config.yaml`
* `install-and-wait-cert-manager` - installs `cert-manager` and waits for it to be ready
* `helm-repos` - adds necessary Helm repositories for external dependencies
* `helm-install` - installs the latest released Armada Operator using Helm from the gresearch Helm registry
* `install-armada-deps` - installs required Armada dependencies such as Prometheus, PostgreSQL, Pulsar and Redis using Helm
* `wait-for-armada-deps` - waits for all Armada dependencies to be ready
* `create-armada-namespace` - creates the Armada namespace `armada`
* `apply-armada-crs` - applies the CRDs of all Armada components using kubectl
* `create-armadactl-config` - creates the armadactl configuration (`~/.armadactl.yaml` file, pointing to `localhost:30002` as per the quickstart guide
* `apply-default-priority-class` - applies the default priority class required by Armada for all jobs
* `get-armadactl` - downloads the armadactl binary for interacting with the Armada API

### Manual setup

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run the Armada Operator. You can use
[Kubernetes in Docker (KIND)](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to run a local cluster for testing, or you
can run against a remote cluster.

To install the latest release of Armada Operator in your cluster, run the following commands:

```bash
# Add the G-Research Helm repository
helm repo add gresearch https://g-research.github.io/charts
# Install the Armada Operator
helm install armada-operator gresearch/armada-operator --namespace armada-system --create-namespace
```

This installs the Armada Operator in the `armada-system` namespace.

### Installing Armada

When installing Armada, you first need to install the Armada external dependencies:

* [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
* [Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

You can install the required Armada dependencies either manually or by running the following `make` target:

```bash
make install-armada-deps
```

**Note:** You need to wait for all dependencies to be running before proceeding to the next step.

Then run the following command to install Armada components using the CRs provided in `dev/quickstart/armada-crs.yaml`:

```bash
# Create armada namespace
kubectl create namespace armada
# Install Armada components
kubectl apply -n armada -f dev/quickstart/armada-crs.yaml
```

`dev/quickstart/armada-crs.yaml` uses NodePort Services for exposing Armada components For example, the Lookout UI at `30000`, the Armada [gRPC](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC) API at `30001` and the Armada REST API at `30002`.

Once every Armada service is deployed, you should have a fully functional installation of Armada.

**Note:** This example, created for use with the `kind` config defined at `hack/kind-config.yaml`, is for demonstration purposes only. Do not use it in production.

### Applying PriorityClass

Armada also requires a default PriorityClass to be set for all jobs. You can apply the default PriorityClass by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f dev/quickstart/priority-class.yaml
```

### Installing `armadactl`

To install `armadactl`, run the following `make` target:

```bash
make get-armadactl
```

Alternatively, download it from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/releases/latest).

Create a configuration file for `armadactl` by running the following command:

```bash
make create-armadactl-config
```

Alternatively, create a configuration file manually in `~/.armadactl.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
currentContext: main
contexts:
  main:
    # URL of the Armada gRPC API
    armadaUrl: localhost:30002 # This uses the NodePort configured in the Quickstart guide
```

## Using `armadactl`

Create a `queue` called `example` by running:

```bash
armadactl create queue example
```

Submit a job to the `example` queue by running:

```bash
armadactl submit dev/quickstart/example-job.yaml
```

Check the status of your job in the Lookout UI by visiting `http://localhost:30000` in your browser. (This assumes that you installed Armada using the Quickstart guide and exposed it via a NodePort service.)

## Migrating

### Migrating to v0.11 and beyond

Since v0.11, Armada Scheduler requires you to configure `permissionGroupsMapping`.

Make sure the `applicationConfig` field in the Armada Scheduler CRD includes the `permissionGroupsMapping` field.

Quickstart example that allows anonymous auth:

```yaml
auth:
  anonymousAuth: true
  permissionGroupMapping:
    execute_jobs: ["everyone"]
```

## Further documentation

To install Armada using the Armada Operator and interact with the Armada API,
[see the Quickstart guide](./dev/quickstart/README.md) and follow the runbooks in the `dev/runbooks/` directory.

For more info on Armada, see the [Armada website](https://armadaproject.io) and the GitHub repository [armadaproject/armada](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada)

To understand the minimal configuration required to deploy Armada services, [see the `armada-crs.yaml`](./dev/quickstart/armada-crs.yaml) file.

For advanced usage, see the Armada CRD reference docs in the `dev/crd/` directory.

## Supported Armada component configurations

Each Armada Operator CRD supports a `.spec.applicationConfig` field, which injects configuration into the Armada component, for example:

* [Armada Server](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/armada/configuration#ArmadaConfig)
* [Armada Executor](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/executor/configuration#ApplicationConfiguration)
* [Armada Scheduler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/scheduler/configuration#Configuration)
* [Armada Scheduler Ingester](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/scheduleringester#Configuration)
* [Armada Lookout](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/lookoutv2/configuration#LookoutV2Config)
* [Armada Lookout Ingester](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/lookoutingesterv2/configuration#LookoutIngesterV2Configuration)
* [Armada Event Ingester](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/eventingester/configuration#EventIngesterConfiguration)
* [Armada Binoculars](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/armadaproject/armada/internal/binoculars/configuration#BinocularsConfig)

## Developing locally

This section assumes you have a `kind` cluster named `armada` running on your machine (it will appear as `kind-armada` in your kubeconfig).

See the Makefile for more commands to help you with your development, or run `make help` for a list of available commands.

Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Starting a development cluster

This section assumes you have [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) installed.

If you do not have a Kubernetes cluster to test against, you can start one using the following command:

```bash
make kind-create-cluster
```

### Building and installing a development cluster

Run the following `make` command:

```bash
make kind-deploy
```
This command does the following:

* builds the `armada-operator` binary for `linux/amd64`
* builds the `armada-operator` Docker image
* loads the Docker image into the `kind` cluster
* installs each CRD supported by the `armada-operator` on the cluster
* installs the `armada-operator` on the cluster using `kustomize`

### Running the Armada Operator locally

To run the operator locally, use one of the following commands:

```bash
# Run the operator locally with webhooks enabled
make run
# Run the operator locally with webhooks disabled
make run-no-webhook
```

### Stopping the development cluster

To stop the development cluster:

```bash
make kind-delete-cluster
```

This will totally destroy your development Kind cluster.

## Contributing

You can contribute bug-reports or ideas for enhancements via GitHub's issue system. 

Code contributions are also welcome. When submitting a pull request, make sure:

* it references a relevant issue
* all CI checks pass

## Testing

You should test contributions thoroughly before you ask for a review. At a minimum, the following should all run without error:

```bash
# Lint code using golangci-lint.
make lint
# Run unit tests.
make test-unit
# Run integration tests.
make test-integration
```

Add and change appropriate unit and integration tests to ensure your changes are covered by automated tests and appear to be correct.

## FAQ

### `kube-prometheus-stack` is not installing

If you get the following error, upgrade your Helm version to `v3.16.2` or later:

```bash
Error: template: kube-prometheus-stack/templates/prometheus/prometheus.yaml:262:11: executing "kube-prometheus-stack/templates/prometheus/prometheus.yaml" at <ne .Values.prometheus.prometheusSpec.scrapeConfigNamespaceSelector nil>: error calling ne: uncomparable type map[string]interface {}: map[]
```
