Armada Operator is a Kubernetes-native Operator for simpler installation of [Armada](https://armadaproject.io).
This project introduces CRDs for Armada services and provides a controller to manage the lifecycle of these services.

## How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster

## Installation

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run the Armada Operator. You can use
[KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to run a local cluster for testing, or you
can run against a remote cluster.

To install the latest release of Armada Operator in your cluster, run the following commands:
```bash
# Add the G-Research Helm repository
helm repo add gresearch https://gresearch.github.io/armada-operator
# Install the Armada Operator
helm install armada-operator gresearch/armada-operator --namespace armada-system --create-namespace
```

The Armada Operator will be installed in the `armada-system` namespace.

### Installing Armada

In order to install Armada, first you will need to install the Armada external dependencies:
* [Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

You can install the required Armada dependencies either manually or by running the following `make` target:
```bash
make install-armada-deps
```

**Note:** You will need to wait for all dependencies to be running before proceeding to the next step.

Finally:
```bash
# Create armada namespace
kubectl create namespace armada
# Install Armada components
kubectl apply -n armada -f dev/quickstart/armada-crds.yaml
```

Which will deploy samples of each CRD. Once every Armada service is deployed,
you should have a fully functional installation of Armada.

## Documentation

For a step-by-step guide on how to install Armada using the Armada Operator and interact with the Armada API,
please read the Quickstart guide in the [documentation](./dev/quickstart/README.md) and follow runbooks in the `dev/runbooks/` directory.

For more info on Armada, please visit the [Armada website](https://armadaproject.io) and the GitHub repository [armadaproject/armada](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada)

## Local development

This section assumes you have a `kind` cluster named `armada` running on your machine (it will appear as `kind-armada` in your kubeconfig).

Check out the Makefile for more commands to help you with your development or run `make help` for a list of available commands.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your 
kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Start a Development Cluster

This section assumes you have [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) installed.

If you do not have a Kubernetes cluster to test against, you can start one using the following command:
```bash
make kind-create-cluster
```

### Build & install from scratch

Run the following `make` command:
```bash
make kind-deploy
```
This command will do the following:
- Build the `armada-operator` binary for `linux/amd64`
- Build the `armada-operator` Docker image
- Load the Docker image into the `kind` cluster
- Install each CRD supported by the `armada-operator` on the cluster
- Install the `armada-operator` on the cluster using `kustomize`

### Run locally

In order to run the operator locally, you can use one of the following commands:
```bash
# Run the operator locally with webhooks enabled
make run
# Run the operator locally with webhooks disabled
make run-no-webhook
```

### Stop the Development Cluster

To stop the development cluster:
```bash
make kind-delete-cluster
```

This will totally destroy your development Kind cluster.

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute bug-reports or ideas for enhancements via 
GitHub's issue system. 

Code contributions are also welcome. When submitting a pull-request please 
ensure it references a relevant issue as well as making sure all CI checks 
pass.

## Testing

Please test contributions thoroughly before requesting reviews. At a minimum:
```bash
# Lint code using golangci-lint.
make lint
# Run unit tests.
make test-unit
# Run integration tests.
make test-integration
```
should all succeed without error. 

Add and change appropriate unit and integration tests to ensure your changes
